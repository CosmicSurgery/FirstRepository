-When setting up double graphs , dual legends mess up formatting

Set up current workspace to work with git

Trying to get moving averages to work in scratchpaper.ipynb

-I'm realizing it will be pretty tricky creating a new dictionary of CDS' for each author, and each category. In order to resample the datetime column I need to only look at one column at a time by the looks of it. It's certainly still possible to do, but may run slower.

-I may be at the point where I want to try and scrap the project and revisit it at a later point. I think for now I'm going to leave the Project alone and package it up into a neat folder.

-Next I'll try to build a project that can make me a little bit more marketable.
    -> something more practical (webscraping??)
    -> Something less dysfunctional, less ambitious, less personal, more interesting.
    
Skills I learned in this project all need to be revisited and re-proven with quality comments:
    -regex
    -pandas
    -bokeh
    -working with datetime objects
    -directory management
