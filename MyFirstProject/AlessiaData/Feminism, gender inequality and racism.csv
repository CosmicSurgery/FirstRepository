I believe that wearing the veil was dictated by religion (both Islam and Christianity) to demand submission to God and to the husband. Woman had to be the one who is not shown, a possession of a man only to stay at home and raise children. Nowadays that changed as the majority of countries don't require a woman to wear a veil, even if it's a strong societal habit, and most women who choose to do it usually do it because of ""respect"". Respect to themselves, to God, to the family and the men. And having the choice to do so is amazing but yet again we should consider; isn't respect a more political correct word for submission? Haven't centuries of cultural evolution, strong patriarchal societies and gender inequalities formed this perception that wearing more clothing, even wearing a veil renders you as a woman who does not provoke and therefore a better woman...? In any way I'm fully 100% supportive of the right of every woman to choose for herself but it's a fact that culture is so fully rooted in ourselves that a choice can be subconsciously dictated to us by others.","I think that it's their right to use their body to protest, but I don't think that they can judge the grade of feminism of a woman based on how much she covers (or uncovers) herself","Yes","Yes, I know exactly what they are","Yes, completely"

That if they show their hair for example then that's less honorable. In my opinion your value as a person and whether you are honorable has nothing to do with what you wear, and it has everything to do with your actions, the way you walk on this earth. Of course it also is a part of tradition, which changes from place to place, but the question is why this tradition exists, that criticises women based on what they show, and if we should continue endorsing this tradition today. It's very much connected with other issues, that all have to do with what you do with your body. For example in some places it's considered less honorable if you're a woman who is sexually active, and it's considered as ""the right thing to do"" either to have very few experiences, or to ""save yourself for marriage"" altogether. So as I've said beforehand, for me your honor and value is based on your inner self, not the choices you make about your appearance.","I think that it's their right to use their body to protest, but I don't think that they can judge the grade of feminism of a woman based on how much she covers (or uncovers) herself","Yes","I might have heard of them but I don't really know what they are","Partially"

Besides, if my put myself into the shoes of the religious females who have to wear veils, I would consider it more like part of the culture and wear it without putting too much emphasis on its symbolic meaning.

First, for both religions, I wouldn't say veils are a symbol of *submission* specifically, but a symbol of gender inequality since men aren't expected to use them (as women are), thus making the custom of wearing veils questionable.

(And that answers the first question about gender inequality being an universal concept, since It doesn't rely on regional or cultural context to exist)

About *submission* in itself, I'd say:

1- it depends the regional/cultural interpretation on ""wearing a veil"" (what does it mean for the local population when women wear them? And what does it mean when women don't?) If ""wearing veils"" influences one's image*, then:

2- it depends on the interpretation of the word submission, which can carry either the idea of someone consciously submitting his or herself to something and/or the idea of someone being forced into submission by external forces. If you interpret *submission* as described in the second case, then yes, I'd say veils are a symbol of submission (since they are used to influence the images of those who wear them and of those who don't)

You can see I didn't need to specify religions here, since the customs vary from region to region. Putting a whole religion in one bucket would be a step back =)

But if the clothing is manipulated by the faith to restrict the individuals rights, it could be seen as a discriminating and dehumanizing piece of clothing. It always depends on the situation, to pin Muslim women to a submissive group of women is not always the answer. Yes it may be in some cases an answer to be true. But some Muslim women may see their clothing as normal or have a sense of pride for their traditional wear. If say men are making their wives wear it as a symbol of control, then the meaning of the wear changes and is therefore seen as a control item. It may not be a gender tyranny over the other but rather a political stance for a tyranny of men to oppress women in their current state.","Nudity may be inappropriate for younger children. A woman can show express themselves in a different way other than that. You dont see men naked and shwoing it all off as pride. Woman are not equal in some countries. I think some countries need to have a revolution where equity exists for both women and men. By showing nudity may objectify women for sexaulization. But if a woman likes to be sexualized in the sense that, that is being herself, then thats fine. If a woman doesn't want to be sexualized, that is also fine, people have preference. But inequality exists in other countries and to extremes in others involving nudity as a religious sin. This is oppressive for women to express themselves the way they would like.","Yes","I might have heard of them but I don't really know what they are","No"
